# All-In-One-Social-Media-Links

This project provides a sleek and interactive social media share menu inspired by a magic indicator. The menu includes links to various social media profiles, allowing users to easily share content across different platforms.


Usage

Open the HTML file in a web browser, and you should see the magic indicator-inspired social media share menu. Clicking the toggle button will reveal the links to various social media platforms.


Customization

Feel free to modify the styles and structure of the menu to suit your project. Update the index.css file to change colors, sizes, or any other visual aspects. You can also extend the list of social media links by adding more <li> elements with corresponding <a> tags.
